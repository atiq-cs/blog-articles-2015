<h3>Comments on this paper by other papers</h3>
<ul><li><a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1592675">On the evolution of user interaction in Facebook</a>, 2009 mentioned paper has demonstrated  that the "strength of ties" varies widely, ranging from pairs of users who are best friends to pairs of users who even wished they weren’t friends.</li>
<li><a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1963503">Differences in the mechanics of information diffusion across topics: idioms, political hashtags, and complex contagion on twitter</a>, 2011 mentions There are multiple ways of defining tie strength from social media data.</li>
<li><a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5462138&tag=1">Routing in Socially Selfish Delay Tolerant Networks</a>, 2010 The best empirical data we can find about social tie strength is from one recent study in which participants rate their friendship nearly uniformly between 0 and 1 [13]. Thus, we generate weights for each node’s social ties that are uniformly distributed within [0,1].</li>
<li><a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1753532">Signed networks in social media</a>, 2010 says For example, portions of our analysis can be viewed as variants on the problem of link prediction [17] and tiestrength prediction [10], but in each case adapted to take the signs of links into account.</li>
<li><a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1753587">What do people ask their social networks, and why?</a>, 2010 says Researchers have explored many aspects of how social networking services are used. For example, Gilbert and Karahalios [12] studied which properties of connections between Facebook users were useful in predicting weak or strong offline social ties. Lampe et al. looked at how university students’ perceptions and use of Facebook changed over time [19].</li>
<li><a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1772790">Modeling relationship strength in online social networks</a>, 2010 mentions In addition, this past work focused on supervised learning methods, which requires human annotation of link strength (e.g., friendship rating [7] or top friend nomination [11]).</li>
<li><a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2145361">Tie strength in question & answer on social network sites</a>, 2012 mentions that Recent work by Gilbert and Karahalios [10] looked at Granovetter's denotation of strong and weak ties within real-life offline social networks and found a series of features (number of mutual friends, number of words exchanged, and so on) that can effectively predict tie strength between friends in an online social network. Granovetter highlighted the role of tie strength in information exchange between people, and as such, models of tie strength online can help us to understand the exchange of information through questions and answers online. We build upon their algorithm in our work looking at what kinds of friends provide valuable answers to questions on SNS.</li>

<p>We wrote a critique on the paper. I am attaching it here if comes useful,</p>

<h3>Critique on <i>Predicting Tie Strength with Social Media</i></h3>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p align="justify">"Predicting tie strength with social media" analyzes social media data to predict tie strength leveraging exploration of theory of tie strength in the light of social science. Mark S. Granovetter laid out the foundation on network analysis with strong and weak ties. Especially he documented the usefulness of weak ties and how information diffusion works with the help of such ties in a network. He also proposed four dimensions of tie strength. However, other works have shown 3 more dimensions: network structure, emotional support and social distance which have impact on tie strength. Based on these seven dimensions Eric Gilbert and Karrie Karahalios derive predictive variables from major dimensions around facebook data and applies statistical methods. Their method achieves 87.2% accuracy. They elaborated cases with interviews where their method failed.</p>

<h4>Critique</h4>
<p align="justify">Their work is novel in that they set a milestone in predicting tie strength using real social media data. However, their method is not generic, their framework for predicting tie strength might not move beyond facebook without considerable modification and redesign. Though facebook has wider attraction to mass people, there are other potential networks such as professional network on LinkedIn, enterprise network on yammer, academic network on academia.edu and so on. They have variations on structure of network, and requirement of different variable. For example, photo sharing, wall etc features might not be available, additionally, there will be other features such as recommendations from colleagues, there can be co-authors in an article or there can be citation to other articles and works. They did a good job performing practical analysis based on the fundamental theories of sociology. However, as Mark Granovetter said socio-metry or network analysis has almost always been peripheral. Similarly, this work is limited to tie strength and does not provide useful insight into other parts of network such as bridges.</p>

<p align="justify">Their work has been limited to exploring around strong and weak ties with a 10 point resolution. There are special types of ties which can be labeled as romantic tie, professor-student tie, advisor-advisee tie, virtual ties (such in online gaming, online dating etc). Trying to label these special ties would provide us with useful insights. However, size of dataset used in their work is small for such analysis where subjects are not from diverse backgrounds. It is possible that snapshot of real world dataset contains wider variations which require different set of variables to measure tie strength. It is also possible that the variables that did not have impact on tie strength on their work at all will show influence in an arrangement that satisfy these conditions of diverse background and variation in network structure. The participants of the project were mostly from similar background. Total number of people in dataset is 35 who share one or more social foci. This small number of people in the dataset do not represent a wider population. They do not introduce much of diversity. There is chance of a number of unexplored variables that might have impact on tie strength. Range for educational difference should be changed for real world data set which had a short scope for the population of participants from University of Illinois.</p>

<p align="justify">Social media data was ensembled with ties that weren't properly detected by measuring variables around seven dimensions as found in error analysis interviews. To detect such ties we need learning mechanism that can learn from variations of the network structure and communications. Moreover, to measure intimacy two predictive variables have been defined: wall intimacy words and inbox intimacy words which use linguistic inquiry and word count dictionary. However, research in limited settings does not make LIWC method perfect yet. Therefore, additional details are required to evaluate the impact of intimacy variables. Other than these shortcomings the paper has successfully evaluated a mechanism to evaluate tie strength using social media data, tie strength being investigated as theory of sociology for a long time.</p>
