Taylor series of a real or complex-valued function \(Æ’(x)\) is,
\begin{align} f(a) + \frac{f\prime(a)}{1!}(x-a) + \frac{f\prime\prime(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \frac{f\prime\prime\prime(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3 + \cdots \end{align}
Another form that has to be verified,
\begin{align} f(x + h) = f(x) + h f^{\prime}(x) + (h^2/2!) f^{\prime \prime}(x + \theta h) \end{align}

Maclaurin series is special case of Taylor series.

Maclaurin series expansion for the function \(e^x\) is given by,
\begin{align} e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{x^4}{24} + \cdots = \sum_{n\geq 0} \frac{x^n}{n!} \end{align}
Substituting \(x = 1\), in the above series we get,
\begin{align} e = 1 + 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{24} + \cdots = \sum_{n\geq 0} \frac{1}{n!} \end{align}
This is one of the many examples where the definition  \(0! = 1\) makes sense.

Math formulas
When \(a \ne 0\), there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
