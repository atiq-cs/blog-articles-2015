<h3>Recognizing a damaged partition table</h3>
<p>There are several reasons why a partition table is damaged. One reason can be experimenting with disks for example, giving a slightly modified (and mistaken sometimes) command to make a USB flash drive bootable (for a live OS). It can also be possible by some faulty usb creator software. Moroever, directly writing an ISO using 'dd' command can result a corrupted partition table. The partition can also be damaged or engineered by a virus to meet certain goals. As these operations are mostly run on USB drives or keys this post shall provide useful instructions to fix such partition tables. Generally these commands are applicable to any kind of hard-disk/usb drive.</p>

<p>You can have a glimpse of the partition table using parted command or fdisk on Linux. In Windows, you can view your partition table using Disk Management Console or using diskpart command (requires admin privilege). For a damaged partition table, if you look at the partition table you will see unexpected partition entries, garbage characters and symbols or combination of them. You will see partition entries that you didn't know existed before. To see list of partitions you can run fdisk command in Linux. An example to use this command on drive sdX is below. You should replace sdX by appropriate drive id i.e., sdc, sdb etc</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; first-line: 1; tab-size: 5; toolbar: false; "># fdisk -l /dev/sdX</pre>
<p>Before proceeding with following procedure be sure to backup data as all data with partitions will be lost after resetting partition table.</p>
<p>To view partition table for drive sdX (replace with appropriate drive id) using parted tool command will be,</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; first-line: 1; tab-size: 5; toolbar: false; "># parted /dev/sdX p</pre>
<p>If your partition table is EFI you must use parted tool.</p>

<h3>Cleaning up or resetting the partition table</h3>
<p>Before proceeding with following procedure be sure to backup data as all data with partitions will be lost after resetting partition table. Procedures for both Windows and Linux platform are presented below. If you are using Linux please skip Windows section.</p>
<h4>Windows Way</h4>
<p>Run command prompt as administrator then run diskpart</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; first-line: 1; tab-size: 5; toolbar: false; ">C:\Windows\system32&gt;diskpart

Microsoft DiskPart version 6.2.9200

Copyright (C) 1999-2012 Microsoft Corporation.
On computer: Matrix-PC</pre>
<p>On disk-part prompt list your disks and select the appropriate one to run clean up operation:</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; first-line: 1; tab-size: 5; toolbar: false; ">DISKPART&gt; list disk

  Disk ###  Status         Size     Free     Dyn  Gpt
  --------  -------------  -------  -------  ---  ---
  Disk 0    Online          465 GB  3072 KB
  Disk 1    Online          465 GB    15 MB
  Disk 2    Online          8 GB        25 MB 

DISKPART&gt; select disk 2

Disk 2 is now the selected disk.</pre>
<p>Now run clean command which will delete all partitions,</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; first-line: 1; tab-size: 5; toolbar: false; ">DISKPART&gt; clean</pre>
<p>This should wipe out all partitions. But if this does not work enough you can go deeper. In that case after 'clean' command run these commands,</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; first-line: 1; tab-size: 5; toolbar: false; ">DISKPART&gt; convert gpt
DISKPART&gt; create partition primary
DISKPART&gt; clean
DISKPART&gt; convert mbr</pre>
<p>Now you can create a new partition and start working with your USB Key</p>
<pre class="brush: plain; first-line: 1; tab-size: 5; toolbar: false; ">DISKPART&gt; create partition primary
DISKPART&gt; format fs=ntfs label="your label" quick</pre>
<br />

<p>At this point, device does not have a partition table. So we have to create one. Our next commands will require root access. As we are using sdc for our example device id of the USB drive. It is the third storage device connected to our system. First two hard disks connected to the system are sda and sdb. <strong>You should use proper device id in the command according to your device id,</strong> Let's see information on current partition table,</p>

<p>Second command provided to GNU Parted creates an ext4 primary partition starting from sector after mbr to the end. There is a way to pass commands with parted tool. For example, <strong>parted /dev/sdc print</strong> will print device information. These are like shortcut commands. However, regarding shortcut to the command 'parted /dev/sdc mkpart primary ext4 1 -1' we need to be careful. If use the command 'parted /dev/sdc mkpart primary ext4 1 -1' it won't work properly. Because while passing commands with parted -1 means different thing than ending sector. If you pass mkpart with parted you must provide correct size in MegaBytes instead of -1 which will work fine. Our third command passed to gparted sets bootable (active) flag to created partition so that it can be used to boot a OS.</p>
<p>Let's format the partition now to create ext4 filesystem in it.</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; first-line: 1; tab-size: 5; toolbar: false;"># mkfs -T ext4 /dev/sdX1</pre>
<p>where sdX1 should be replaced by sdc1 (which means the first partition on drive sdc) if your flash drive is sdc</p>
<p>Optionally, you can apply a label to the filesystem, it is used by the OS during automount target</p>
<pre class="brush: bash; first-line: 1; tab-size: 5; toolbar: false; "># e2label /dev/sdX1 My_Linux_USB_Drive
Warning: label too long, truncating.</pre>
<p>When label is too long it truncates.</p>
