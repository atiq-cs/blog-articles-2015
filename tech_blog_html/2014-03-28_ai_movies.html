<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> on Movies and books primarily give us insights into the details of human imagination on artificial intelligence. Many of these movies are based on science fiction books. While recreating and retelling the stories of artificial intelligence some movies have been successful in drawing viewer’s interest bringing artificial intelligence and relevant fields such as cognitive science, data mining, representation, logics, bioinformatics, human computer interaction and design of user of interface together. We see examples of following those imaginary stories and bringing dreams into reality in modern times with innovation of technology and science. While some movies present problems with human emotion and machine interaction to make it further interesting some of those actually provide some details into implementation of A.I ideas. Though far from reality, sometimes they are so high quality fascination that are likely to take you into a journey of different world. Moreover, science fiction writers notably Isaac Asimov takes you to prime of his imagination of high-tech world with problems and features equally surprising.</p>

Without knowledge on the subject of the story some people found the movie slow and boring. However, this movie draws a good theme on story of evolution of intelligent beings. And, this evolution is very much related to vicinity of a monolith. Artificially intelligent HAL computers become critically obstacle in achieving human evolution what is required to evolve by travelling to moon and reaching the monolith that is placed there. In a space journey for that, first ever conflict between evolution of human beings and artificially intelligent robotic systems erupts. It is to wonder who finally wins!

<p>Movies in Terminator Trilogy are about future revolutions of machines against human race. These are ferocious, highly advanced, artificially intelligent robots and bio-technologically elite systems. Time travel mysteries have already been unravelled. Directed by James Cameron the movie is well made.</p>

<p>Judgment Day (1991) just gets better with new plots based on the previous story. It can be said as developed almost immaculate as a story Robot/cyborg as friend and robot as foe. Arnold Schwarzenegger has matched the character with his finnesse of acting and appearance.</p>
