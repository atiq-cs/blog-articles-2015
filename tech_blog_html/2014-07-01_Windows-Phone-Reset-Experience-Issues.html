<h3>Resetting Windows Phone</h3>
<h4>Possible Reasons Behind Resetting Windows Phone</h4>
<p>One of the most common reasons to reset Windows Phone is to change Windows Live ID. WP does not allow you to change to another Live ID easily. Though it is possible to add several live IDs for syncing contacts, mail etc they won’t be used in some important services such as Market Place (required for application update), Windows Phone Skydrive. When you make changes to your default live id account such as changing default alias you find that you cannot use the account anymore on the phone as it requires updateing the information regarding Live ID on the phone. Users are forced to change Live ID by resetting Windows Phone. In other cases when phone is behaving weird or you messed up some settings of the phone you might want to reset the phone as well.</p>

<p>Before resetting Windows Phone it is useful to know what information you will lose after performing reset,</p>
<h4>Information Lost after Resetting Windows Phone</h4>
<p>Here is a tentative list of data/information you will lose after the reset procedure is complete,</p>
<ul><li>Messages (SMS, chat conversations using Live)</li>
<li>Emails</li>
<li>Contacts, Calendar, Tasks etc</li>
<li>Theme, ringtones etc settings, WIFI passwords and menu customizations</li>
<li>All of your Windows Phone Applications installed via Market Place and data</li>
<li>Music, Video, Podcasts etc that were synced using Zune</li>
<li>Internet Explorer history and Settings</li></ul>
<p>Basically, the Phone contains the settings and content of a new windows phone where you lose all information stored in a long time. You will see all memory released and available.</p>

<h4>Backup before Reset</h4>
<p>Following backup can help minimize the disaster,</p>
<ul><li>Settings: There are options to backup settings of Windows Phone. However, in Windows Phone 7 this option might not be available i.e., on the Windows Phone 7 manufactured by HTC. Here is a place with detail instruction on backing up settings of Windows Phone: <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/back-up-my-stuff">windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/back-up-my-stuff</a></li>
<li>Backup contacts via sync with Google Contacts, Live contacts or using a supported service.</li>
<li>Sync office docs from Phone using Skydrive/Onedrive.</li>
<li>Sync Music, Video, Podcasts etc using Zune</li></ul>

<h3>Windows Phone Issues</h3>
<h4>Issue 2 – when you change SIM you may have an issue with contacts on your Windows Phone</h4>
<p>Only reproducible with insertion of a different SIM card. You might lose some info of contacts. Especially photos you set manually to contacts and other info might be lost or get messed up.</p>

<h4>Issue 3 – setting a ringtone</h4>
<p>This should be a trivial task. Have a look at the instruction: <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/start/create-ringtones">Windows Phone - Add or create ringtone</a></p>

<h4>Issue 4 – Reviewing Microsoft Contacts</h4>
<p>Microsoft Contacts now named <a href="https://people.live.com/">people</a> has a lot to improve, checking out the competitors services can be a good idea. This service has several drawbacks; mentionable one is that you can not add a photo to contact using the web version and if you set a photo to a contact from Phone it does not sync to the online one. If you somehow lose the phone these photos are lost as they are not synced with the web version. Other drawback is its lack of user friendly interface.</p>

<h4>Issue 5 – Google Contacts is no more Working with the Update of Windows Phone 7.8 and after a reset</h4>
<p>Consider this scenario. Google Contacts was working fine with your Windows Phone 7. You updated it to 7.8 then it was working also. However, after changing live ID performing reset you will find this is no more working. Problem is described at <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-8/use-google-windows-8-rt">Microsoft - Google Contacts</a> and <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/how-to/wp7/people/sync-google-email-contacts-and-calendars-faq">for Windows Phone 7</a>. However, there is workaround. Please use the server m.google.com on Windows Phone 7.8 Thanks google for keeping this alive.</p>


<h3>Windows Phone Experience</h3>
<h4>Situations when Windows Phone can be useful</h4>
<p>Windows Phone will come handy when your works are more related to Microsoft Products, for example,</p>
<ul><li>You work a lot on Microsoft Office and most of your documents are in Microsoft’s format.</a></li>
<li>You use Microsoft products such as Sky Drive, Microsoft Exchange server etc a lot. You will definitely enjoy the integration.</li>
<li>Most of the Windows Phone video playback is good as well as the camera (N.B: Phone camera not comparable with Professional Cameras).</li>
<li>You are familiar with Zune Software and would like to play Xbox Games</li>
<li>Or let's say you like an Uniform User interface like Metro that is more resembling toward Windows</ul>

<h4>What you miss on Windows Phone</h4>
<p>Roughly you will miss following with Windows Phone</p>
<ul><li>Google Chrome</li>
<li>Bluetooth file transfer support is bad if you are using HTC Windows Phone 7</li>
<li>Some funny apps such as Talking Cat that are available on iPhone and Android</li>
<li>If you are using Windows Phone 7 or 7.8 or any version lower than Windows Phone 8 you will miss USSD Menu. Though USSD code is supported, menu reply from USSD is not supported on these phone operating systems yet.</li>
<li>Support for languages like Bengali if you are using Windows Phone 7</li></ul>

<h4>Improving Battery Life of Windows Phone</h4>
<p>Some of the Windows Phones don’t have strong battery for heavy works. In that case, you can do following to improve battery life especially when you are running out of battery and still wanna make couple of phone calls using your phone disabling mentioned features would turn out useful.</p>
<ul><li>Disabling Cellular Data Connection if not necessary</li>
<li>Disabling Location Service if it is not necessary</li>
<li>Disabling WiFi Network if you are not using internet services</li></ul>

<h4>Bangla (Bengali) Support in Windows Phone 7</h4>
<p>Bangla is supported in Windows Phone 8. However, earlier releases though have built-in Unicode support does not have support for Bangla. Hence, across the Phone Bangla is not supported. For example, if you use the official facebook application on Windows Phone 7 you will find all characters are being represented indiscriminately using rectangular boxes. However, still Windows Phone 7 has nice Bangla User Interface in following applications,</p>
