<p>I have used a number of scripts to help facilitate a number of tasks: some of them are complex, others simple. Most of these are Windows batch scripts. However, I'm going to add more Linux scripts soon.</p>
<p>There are approximately a hundred scripts in the repository at the time of updating this post. Please visit here: <a href="https://github.com/atiq-cs/Scripts-And-Utilities">https://github.com/atiq-cs/Scripts</a>. and some reusable executable components that are parts of these scripts (helps achieve certain goals). I’m putting a brief summary here.</p>
