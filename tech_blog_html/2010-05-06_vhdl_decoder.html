<p>To design a 2 to 4 Decoder only using Behavioral VHDL we need to define input port and output ports. Afterwards, we need to define the logic for them in architecture. The code looks like below,</p>

<p>We use our design for 2 to 4 to build 3 to 8 decoder (using structural HDL). We reuse the component decoder2to4 and define logical functions to derive 3to4 decoder from 2 to 4. Depending on the logical relation among output ports and input you are welcome to draw a diagram.
